# ETL-Framework
I will share with you a Google Drive folder (containing three files: Timeline.docx labeled as the research proposal, ETL Framework, and the Research Report).

The file you provided, Timeline.docx, will serve as the initial draft of the research proposal. You can use it, merging it with the Historic Data Loading file, to create a more complete research proposal. There are a few important details missing from your draft—for example, issues like redundant column names within the same file and other considerations—which should be addressed in the final research proposal.

The format of the proposal is based on the plan, what you will do, what you will deliever.

Once the research proposal and its implementation are complete, the final step will be to prepare a comprehensive Research Report this is based on issues you didnt account for when I test code accroding to my data including more details in the file give about it.

The format research report is based on the product. Some overlap of the report and the proposal is expected.
